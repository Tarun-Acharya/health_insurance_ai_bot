# Health Insurance Document AI

**Health Insurance Document AI** is a generative AI-powered tool designed to read and interpret health insurance PDFs. It provides real-time answers on coverage, pricing, and other details directly from the document. This project utilizes advanced machine learning models and technologies to offer a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ Features

- **AI Model:** Utilizes Llama from Hugging Face, fine-tuned with Unsloth AI on a comprehensive health insurance plans corpus.
- **RAG Pipeline:** Implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline with Chroma DB for accurate and relevant information retrieval.
- **User Interface:** Developed with Flask for an intuitive and user-friendly interaction.
- **Local Hosting:** Hosted locally on Ollama to ensure privacy and high performance.
